I have to get to the bottom of this audio Mike issue on Oasis which is as you know Windows machine RTX 3060 i5 13400 32g ram so I’m using a Zoom audio interface the Zoom L2 and a sure MX 7V I think it’s called microphone. It’s all a great set up except for sometimes this setting the last image there I want where it says test microphone audio processing, choose different modes. If I do communications it’s much better, but for some reason that slides back to default a lot, wh...",2026-01-03 02:28:40,Legal,User,important,decision,
"Good morning, Tom","Good morning, Tom. You're dealing with a frustrating but solvable issue: Windows keeps resetting your **input device’s processing mode**—from ""Communications"" back to ""Default""—which breaks your voice pickup for **Voice In**, especially given your setup:

- **Shure MV7** mic (not MX7V—it’s MV7)
- **Windows 11** on your **Oasis RTX 3060 i5-13400 rig**

Let’s solve this permanently by locking down optimal mic settings and minimizing Windows interference.

## ✅ 1. Correct Setting on the “Listen” Tab

In the Control Panel’s **Line Properties → Listen tab**, you want:

- **[✓] Listen to this device**: ❌ **LEAVE UNCHECKED** (unless you're trying to monitor input in real time through your system speakers, which you are not).
- **Playback through this device**:
  If you *do* ever check that box, choose **Line (ZOOM L-12 Audio)** to avoid feedback loops or unexpected rerouting—but in your case:

"You're so welcome, Tom — that sounds like a solid plan","You're so welcome, Tom — that sounds like a solid plan. 🛠️🎙️

Here’s your quick **recap**:

### ✅ Locked Down:

- Input device set to **Zoom L-12**, with **Communications mode**
- Windows exclusive control disabled
- Enhancements off
- “Listen to this device” correctly **left unchecked**
- PowerShell script ready to persist settings after reboot

### 🧭 Next Steps:

- Monitor behavior over the next few reboots and work sessions
- If anything slides back (like the mode or gain), ping me...",2026-01-03 02:28:40,Legal,Assistant,important,decision,
